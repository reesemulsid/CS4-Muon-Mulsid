create three Monsters, one of each type (you may choose the values for the Monsters).
Simulate 3 separate battles, Grass vs Fire, Fire vs Water, and Water vs Grass.
Create a loop so that they repeatedly attack each other until one or both HP is reduced to 0.
There is no need for user input in the main method, so you may hardcode the entire process.
