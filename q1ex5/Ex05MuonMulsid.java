/*
With what youâ€™ve learned so far, you should be able to do the following:
Create an array or ArrayList containing different data
Loop over the different indices of the arrays and ArrayLists to check and use the content
Given the attached Item.java, we can create a store, which is essentially just an array of Items. Complete
the Store.java so that the application is able to work as specified in StoreSim.java;

Submit the package in a compressed zip folder. The package should contain 3 java files, Store.java,
Item.java, and the java file containing the main method.
